Improve your productivity and care of your health while working in a funny way! 

Hi! Let me tell a few about the project.
The application was developed during the Next Level Week 4, released by Rocketseat. Based on the "Pomodoro Method", with the app Moveit the user will do their work, be productive and take care of their health. How does it work? 

The app have a 25 minutes countdown, during these 25 minutes the user can do the work and when this cicle is done, the app will notificate you with a challenge like "stand up and take a 3 minutes walk" or some exercises for the eyes. If the challenge is done, the cicle starts again and the user receive XP points, if failed, you can start the countdown again and at the end, receive another challenge.

Win XP and level up taking care of your health and being productive!
